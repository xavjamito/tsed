It&#39;s built with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TypeScript</a> and uses classes (OOP), decorators and Functional programming to develop your application.</p><p>It uses <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Express.js</a> HTTP server frameworks by default, but it&#39;s also possible to use <a href="https://koajs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Koa.js</a> or <a href="https://www.serverless.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Serverless</a> as well.</p><p>Ts.ED provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Koa) with the <a href="/docs/platform-api.html">Platform API</a> but also exposes their APIs directly for the developer. It gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party node modules which are available for the underlying platform.</p><div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top:8px;"><p>Just want to try it out?

Each of these projects bring their vision of a web application, but we have the same wish, to make the developer&#39;s life easier by providing all the right tools to developers so that they are quickly productive.</p><p>Ts.ED tends towards the same objective which is to achieve better productivity while remaining easy to understand. To achieve this, Ts.ED provides out-of-the-box an application architecture, highly testable, scalable and maintainable.</p>',9)]))}const u=t(o,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
